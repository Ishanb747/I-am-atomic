        "content": "What’s better than spontaneously registering for a well-known Robotics tournament and thriving until the very last minute to be done with the making of our robot for it? That adrenaline rush is just what each of us craves. And that’s precisely how we, A.T.O.M. Labs, started this journey. The A.T.O.M. Labs recently attended Cognizance, IIT Roorkee’s prestigious annual technical festival, on a journey fuelled by creativity and fellowship. Our team found itself in the center of a flurry of robotics challenges, enthralling concerts, and exhilarating gaming tournaments as the best technical brains in the country converged. One of the best things was getting to work on different robotics projects and thinking out of the box to make every approach better than before."

And in the heat of a gripping robotics challenge, our team devised a formidable solution: a manually controlled bot equipped with a state-of-the-art 3D-printed gripper, two powerful motors, Arduino Nano, and motor drivers. Through innovation and collaboration, we overcame hurdles, and honed our design."

        "content": "while trying it’s best to not hit walls and that’s exactly how the problem statement of “Nano Navigators” came to existence. Tasked with navigating intricate mazes in record time while minimizing collisions, we delved into an arena where every turn, every twist, presented a new puzzle to solve. Armed with a formidable array of sensors and components, including three ultrasonic sensors, four IR sensors, Arduino Uno, two motors, and a motor driver, our quest for perfection began. Despite initial setbacks with Flood Fill algorithm implementation, we pivoted to a left wall following strategy, harnessing the power of precise sensor data to guide our bot through labyrinthine corridors. With a chassis crafted from 3D-printed parts and acrylic sheet, our creation embodied resilience and agility, weaving through the maze with grace and precision."
